\description{
A dataset containing four lines of fabricated JAX Envision® activity data.
These lines follow the format of a JAX Envision® activity CSV.
When read properly, the lines for cage-level data have raw column titles as follows:

\details{
\itemize{
\item \code{start}. the date and time at the start of the aggregation bin (coerced from UTC to local time).
\item \code{start_date_local}. the start date (in the time zone in which the data were collected).
\item \code{start_time_local}. the start time (in the time zone in which the data were collected).
\item \code{study_code}. a unique code for each study.
\item \code{aggregation_seconds}. the number of seconds aggregated to generate this dataset (3600 is 1 hour).
\item \code{group_name}. a user-defined group name, often used to label experimental groups of interest.
\item \code{cage_name}. the name of the cage that the data represent.
\item \code{animals_cage_quantity}. the number of animals in the cage, sometimes called cage density or occupancy.
\item \code{light_cycle}. whether the data were collected in the light or dark cycle.
\item \code{movement_mean_per_cage_cm_s_hour}. cage-level movement in cm/s for a specified period of time (1 hour in this example)
\item \code{wheel_occupancy_mean_per_cage_animals_hour}. amount of time spent on the wheel at the cage level.
\item \code{food_occupancy_mean_per_cage_animals_hour}. amount of time spent in proximity to the food hopper at the cage level.
\item \code{water_occupancy_mean_per_cage_animals_hour}. amount of time spent in proximity to the water bottles at the cage level.
\item \code{tzone}. time zone of the dataset.
